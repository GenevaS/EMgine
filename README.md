## EMgine (Emotion Engine) ##

This is the project directory for EMgine (Emotion Engine), a Computational Model 
of Emotion (CME) for Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to enhance their believability, 
with the goal of improving long-term player engagement. EMgine is for 
*emotion generation*, accepting user-defined information from a game environment 
to determines what emotion and intensity a NPC is ``experiencing''. How the 
emotion is expressed and what other effects it could have on game entities is 
left for game designers/developers to decide.

The repository for this project is organized as:

1. docs: Any and all documentation produced during EMgine's development
2. refs: Supporting research and resources
