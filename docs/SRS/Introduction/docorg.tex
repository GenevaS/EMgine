\subsection{Organization of Document}\label{sec:doc_org}
The rest of this document is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A general description of \progname{} (Section~\ref{sec_genDesc}),
    including the system context and constraints, as well as characteristics of
    the intended end users

    \item The problem description (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}), which defines
    terminology necessary for understanding subsequent models and requirements,
    a description of the physical system that \progname{} exists in, and the
    goals that \progname{} must achieve through its requirements

    \item A solution characteristics descriptions (Section~\ref{Sec_scs}),
    documenting \progname{}'s models, types, assumptions, data constraints and
    definitions, and properties of a correct solution

    \item \progname{}'s functional and non-functional requirements
    (Section~\ref{sec_Reqs})

    \item Future changes, both likely and unlikely, to \progname{}'s solution
    characteristics specification (Section~\ref{sec_Changes})

    \item Traceability matrices and graphs (Section~\ref{sec_trace}), visually
    describing the dependencies between document components, for reference
    if/when making changes to \progname{}'s specifications

    \item Suggestions for other CME designs, components, and extensions
    (Appendices~\ref{appendix_extensions}, \ref{appendix_cognitive},
    \ref{appendix_lazarus}), including preliminary assumptions, models, and
    type definitions
\end{itemize}
