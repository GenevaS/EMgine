\subsection{Purpose of Document}\label{sec:doc_purpose}
This document represents the specifications of \progname{} as a self-contained
system that interfaces with external systems. It describes all of \progname{}'s
necessary functionality, and the underlying assumptions and models derived from
affective science, psychology, and emotion theory literature.

This document's purpose is to guide the design of \progname{}'s architecture
and interfaces, as well as the development of its test plan. After initial
development, the document's purpose is to aid in the use, maintenance, and
further development of \progname{}. This includes activities that change
\progname{}'s existing components, such as those described in the likely
changes (Section~\ref{sec_Expand}), or add new components.
