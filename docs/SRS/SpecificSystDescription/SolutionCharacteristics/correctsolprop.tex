\begin{itemize}

    \item The emotion kinds and intensities generated by \progname{} must be
    reasonable with respect to a believable animated character for the
    eliciting context as defined in the related document ``Validation Test Plan
    for \progname{}: A Computational Model of Emotion for Enhancing Non-Player
    Character Believability in Games (Version~\validatetestplanVersion)''

    \item All of \progname{}'s outputs must adhere to its associated data type
    definition(s) as defined in Section~\ref{sec_typedefs}, which can be
    verified by type checking all references to them for type safety
