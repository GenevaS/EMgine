\section{Specific System Description}\label{sec_SpecDesc}
This section first presents the problem description, giving a high-level view 
of the problem to solve (\ref{Sec_pd}), some terminology and definitions to 
clarify models, data, and requirements (Section~\ref{sec_terms}), and goals 
that a solution must achieve (Section~\ref{sec_goals}). It then describes 
characteristics of a potential solution, including Assumptions 
(Section~\ref{sec_assumptions}), Theoretical Models 
(Section~\ref{sec_theoretical}), General and Data Definitions 
(Sections~\ref{sec_gendef} and~\ref{sec_datadef}), Data Types 
(Section~\ref{sec_typedefs}), and the Instance Models derived from these 
(Section~\ref{sec_instance}). This is followed by Constraints 
(Section~\ref{sec_DataConstraints}) and Properties of a Correct Solution 
(Section~\ref{sec_CorrectSolution}).

One section---Conceptual Models (Section~\ref{sec_conceptual})---has been added 
to the solution characteristics that is not in the SRS template in 
\cite{SmithAndLai2005} and \cite{SmithEtAl2007}. It is useful for maintaining a 
direct connection to the affective research behind the Theoretical and Instance 
Models. The Theoretical Models also differ from those in the template, focusing 
on rewriting descriptions in the Conceptual Models with more precise natural 
language. This shows what interpretation of the Conceptual Models that lead to 
their mathematical representations in the Data Types and Instance Models.
