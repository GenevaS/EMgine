\subsubsection{Atomic Test Units}\label{sec:sys-nf-atomic}
\progname{}'s architecture suggests that it can be verified on a per-component
basis. Therefore, \progname{}'s test suite must demonstrate that the tests
related to each component can be run independently of the others
(\nfref{N_Atomic}). Inputs required from other components must be mocked to
demonstrate the component's ability to operate as expected to build confidence
in its ability to integrate with non-\progname{} methods.
