\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}
These tests evaluate the ability for \progname{}'s implementation to support
the Robustness and Performance nonfunctional requirement categories in
\progname{}'s SRS, as well as \nfref{N_Atomic} from the Verifiability category,
because they depend on \progname{}'s implementation and test organization alone.

Nonfunctional requirement \nfref{N_Trace} and those in the categories of
Maintainability, Reusability, Portability, Operational \& Interoperability,
Understandability, Usability, Look \& Feel, Culture (World), Culture (Game
Development Work), and Legal are not tested here because they require end-user
involvement. This is addressed in \progname{}'s Acceptance Test Plan (ATP).
