\subsection{Scope of Testing Efforts}
The overall goals of \progname{}'s system, integration, and unit testing effort
are:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Ensure traceability between \progname{}'s verification efforts and
    its SRS, MG, and MIS

    \item Build confidence in the correctness and accuracy of \progname{}'s
    source code

    \item Build confidence in \progname{}'s overall verification efforts

\end{enumerate}

This test plan must be \textit{reviewed} for each new major version of
\progname{}'s SRS, MG, and/or MIS and revised accordingly. This ensures that
these testing efforts remain relevant throughout \progname{}'s development. For
new minor versions of \progname{}'s SRS, MG, and/or MIS, the review can be
limited to only those sections related to SRS, MG, and/or MIS modifications to
help reduce the effort required when testing the next major version.

This test plan must be \textit{executed} in full for each new major version of
\progname{}'s source code. Previous versions do not need to be retested. The
SIUTP can be partially executed for new minor versions of the source code to
help reduce the effort required when testing the next major version.

The SIUTP describes the ``Dynamic Testing Method'' for Implementation
Verification referenced in \progname{}'s Master Test Plan (MTP)
Section~\ref{plan:implementation}.
