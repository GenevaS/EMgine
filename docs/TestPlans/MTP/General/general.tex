\section{Introduction}
This document gives an overview of the test planning and management for
\progname{}. Its purpose is to describe the overall goals of the testing
efforts, how they relate to \progname{}'s concept, and where they fit in
\progname{}'s Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It describes the
necessary testing activities from concept to validation, including what is
required to do the activities and their expected outcomes and completion time.

The document's content and organization is loosely based on IEEE Std 829-2008
