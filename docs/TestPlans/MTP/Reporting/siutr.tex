\subsection{System, Integration, and Unit Test Report}\label{reporting:siutr}
The System, Integration, and Unit Test Report (SIUTR) provides an overview of
the testing efforts made towards executing the ``System, Integration, and Unit
Test Plan for \progname{}: A Computational Model of Emotion for Enhancing
Non-Player Character Believability in Games''. The SIUTR must include all of
the sections described for the Acceptance Test Report (ATR,
Section~\ref{reporting:atr}) and relate its contents to the System,
Integration, and Unit Test Plan (SIUTP) instead of the Acceptance Test Plan
(ATP).
