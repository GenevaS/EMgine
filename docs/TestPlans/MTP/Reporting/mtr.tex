\subsection{Master Test Report}\label{reporting:mtr}
The Master Test Report (MTR) provides an overview of all V \& V efforts,
including those documented in other test reports. The document's content and
organization is based on IEEE Std 829-2008 Clause 17: Master Test
Report~\citep{vvDocIEEE}. The MTR must include:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Document Revision History

    \item Reference Material (e.g. symbols, acronyms, definitions)

    \item Introduction \\
    Identify who prepared the report, its purpose, and its current status (e.g.
    Draft, Final)
    \begin{enumerate}

        \item Scope \\
        Summarize the components of \progname{} tested, which might include a
        reference/addition/ changes to the Master Test Plan (MTP) and/or a
        component's testing history

        \item Relevant Documentation \\
        Provide references to documents necessary for compiling the MTR,
        including the: Acceptance Test Report (Section~\ref{reporting:atr}),
        System, Integration, and Unit Test Report
        (Section~\ref{reporting:siutr}), and all other test reports created
        during V \& V; and Software Development Artifacts (SDAs) and standards
        (e.g. IEEE Std 829-2008)

    \end{enumerate}

    \item Details of the MTR \\
    ``This section describes the overview of all aggregate test results,
    rational for any decisions, and the final conclusions and
    recommendations.''~\citep[p.~67]{vvDocIEEE}
    \begin{enumerate}

        \item Overview of Aggregated Test Results \\
        Provide executive-level summaries of testing activities and tasks with
        references to the MTP (i.e. Section~\ref{testplan_highlevel}),
        categorized summaries of resolved and unresolved issues with references
        to reports (Section~\ref{reporting:issues}), summaries of collected
        metrics, and an overall assessment of \progname{}'s quality with
        justification

        \item Decision Rationale \\
        Explain if \progname{} passes or fails its V \& V; if it conditionally
        passes, describe the qualifying restrictions and/or issues that must be
        resolved for \progname{} to pass

        \item Conclusions and Recommendations \\
        Describe the overall evaluation of \progname{}, recommendations and
        circumstances for use, recommendations concerning its readiness for
        release, lessons learned during testing which might include the
        identification of issue categories and/or root cause analysis, and how
        to handle deferred issues

    \end{enumerate}
