\subsection{Issue Report}\label{reporting:issues}
The Issue Report (IR) is for documenting any event that happens during testing
that must be investigated. The document's content and organization is a
combination of IEEE Std 829-2008 Clause 14: Anomaly Report~\citep{vvDocIEEE}.
The ATR must include:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Document Revision History

    \item Introduction \\
    Identify who prepared the report, its purpose, and its current status (e.g.
    Draft, Final)
    \begin{enumerate}

        \item Issue Identification Code/Number

        \item Scope \\
        Describe any contextual information necessary for understanding the IR

        \item Relevant Documentation \\
        Provide references to documents necessary for understanding the IR,
        such as a reference to a test plan and/or report

    \end{enumerate}

    \item Details of the IR \\
    ``This section identifies the items contained in the [IR] including its
    status and corrective actions taken.''~\citep[p.~61]{vvDocIEEE}
    \begin{enumerate}

        \item Summary \\
        Provide a summary of the issue

        \item Status of the Issue \\
        State the current status of the issue as one of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Open
            \item Assigned
            \item Fixed
            \item Retested with Fix
            \item Resolved
        \end{itemize}

        \item Description of Issue \\
        Provide a description of the issue, sufficient conditions to
        reproduce it, which might include inputs, expected and actual outputs,
        unexpected outcomes, procedure step, environment, attempts to repeat
        the test, and the involved testers and/or observers, and any
        observations and/or activities that could help isolate and correct the
        issue

        \item Context \\
        Identify the version and components of the Software Development
        Artifact (SDA) and/or Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) stage the
        issue was discovered in; and the associated test level and items with
        their version level involved in the discovery

        \item Date Discovered \\
        Record the date that the issue was first discovered

        \item Impact \\
        If known, describe the breadth and depth of the issue's impact on
        affected SDAs and/or stakeholder needs, and any known workarounds for
        the issue

        \item Description of Corrective Action \\
        Provide a summary of the activities taken to resolve the issue, which
        can include deferral or retirement of duplicate issue

        \item Conclusions and Recommendations \\
        Describe the source/cause of the issue and/or provide recommendations
        for changes to development and/or testing processes to help prevent
        this issue in the future

    \end{enumerate}
