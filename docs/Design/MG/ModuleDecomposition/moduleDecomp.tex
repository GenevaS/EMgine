\section{Module Decomposition}\label{SecMD}
Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. Each module documents:
\begin{itemize}

    \item Its \emph{Secrets}, a brief statement of the design decision hidden 
    by the module, 

    \item Its \emph{Services}, specifying \emph{what} the module will do 
    without documenting \emph{how} to do it.

    \item A suggestion for what the module should be \emph{Implemented By}. If 
    this is \emph{OS}, it means that the operating system or a standard 
    programming language library provides the module. The system being designed 
    does not need to provide them. If a there is a dash (\emph{--}), the module 
    is \textit{not} a leaf node in the module hierarchy (Section~\ref{SecMH}). 
    It is a ``virtual'' module, and will not have to be implemented unless 
    required by a programming language.

\end{itemize}
%Also indicate if the module will be implemented specifically for the software.
