\subsection{Software Decision Module}

\begin{description}[font=\scshape]
    \item[Secrets:] The design decision based on mathematical theorems,
    physical facts, or programming considerations. The secrets of this module
    are \emph{not} described in the SRS. For \progname{}, these are are
    user-defined modules.

    \item[Services:] \progname{} provides the API describing necessary data
    types and methods, but the end-user must implement them as they are unique
    to their application (e.g. video game).

\subsubsection{World State Module (\mref{mWorld})}

\begin{description}[font=\scshape]
    \item[Secrets:] Implementation of the World State data structure.

    \item[Services:] Provides an API of methods for using the World State View
    (WSV), World Event, Distance Between WSVs, and Distance Change Between WSVs
    data types necessary for \progname{}.
