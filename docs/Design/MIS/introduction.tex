\section{Introduction}
This document details the Module Interface Specifications for \progname{}, a
Computational Model of Emotion (CME) for Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to
enhance their believability, with the goal of improving long-term player
engagement. \progname{} is for \textit{emotion generation}, accepting
user-defined information from a game environment to determines what emotion
and intensity a NPC is ``experiencing''. How the emotion is expressed and what
other effects it could have on game entities is left for game
designers/developers to decide.

Other necessary documents include the Software Requirement Specification and
Module Guide. You can find the full documentation and implementation at
